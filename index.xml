      <description>Figure 1: Migratory movements of white storks Ciconia ciconia on a Mapbox satellite base map  This month, our open-access paper on visualizing movement trajectories in R using moveVis has been published in the latest issue of Methods in Ecology and Evolution. The article describes the moveVis user functions, explains their technical implementation, provides use cases and discusses its strengths and limitations.
The visualization of movement trajectories sometimes is not easy.</description>

Last Thursday, on November 28th, 2019, our annual PhD colloquium took place at the Earth Observation Center (EOC) at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen. As every year, the current PhD students of Prof. Dr. Stefan Dech met to present the concepts and statuses of their PhDs and to discuss their approaches and ideas within a larger group.</description>

Yesterday, on November 14th, 2018, the annual PhD colloquium of PhD candiates supervised by Prof. Dr. Stefan Dech met at the Earth Observation Center (EOC) at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen to talk about their PhD topics and statuses. Each PhD candidate presented her or his PhD concept and status and addressed challenges and successes of the past year, followed by a discussion with the present candidates and supervisors.</description>

      <title>Spectral unmixing in R using RStoolbox</title>

      <description>Recently, I finished the development of the first version of a spectral unmixing function being part of RStoolbox, an R package offering numerous tools for remote sensing analysis written by Benjamin Leutner. The multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (mesma) function makes it possible to unmix multi- and hyper-spectral imagery by sets of spectral endmember profiles.
 Figure 1: The RStoolbox::mesma() workflow.  For this, a non-negative least squares (NNLS) solver was implemented.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: An Eastern Turkey Vulture (C. a. septentrionalis) in flight (Canada). Source: Peter K Burian/CC BY-SA  The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) is the most widespread scavenging bird on the american continents, ranging from southern Canada to the tip of South America. Since 2003, the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is collecting movement data of Turkey Vultures to investigate their migration behaviours, using radio tags monitored by satellite. 21 Turkey Vultures have been tracked during that period of time.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: An Albatross in the air. Source: pexels.com  In the framework of the AniMove summer school 2017, the moveVis R package was introduced to the participants, resulting in several likewise interesting and beautiful animal movement animations. The shown animation displays the movement of Procellariiformes near Marion Island, South Africa, against the multi-temporal, daily NOAA sea surface temperature product G1SST. It was created by Tegan Carpenter-Kling, who is a PhD candidate within the Marine Apex Predator Research Unit (MAPRU) based at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.</description>
