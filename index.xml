      <description>Introduction Installing Ubuntu onto a computer is not complicated: One just needs to boot a live image (e.g. from a USB drive or served via the network) and the user is prompted with the option to install Ubuntu onto the host’s internal hard drive. After a few steps, the installation is done and the system is ready.&#xA;However, this process is interactive, i.e. it requires user input to complete the installation.</description>

      <description>Introduction VirtualBox is a widely used virtualization software that allows you to install and run entire operating systems as virtual machines (VMs) on a host system. For this, one can create virtual hard disks that are physically stored on the host, e.g. as dynamically expanding .vdi or .vmdk image files. VirtualBox attaches these disks to the respective VM so that the VM can mount them as if they were physical devices and use them to store volumes on it, e.</description>

      <description>The Open Data Cube is an open-source data management architecture explicitly tailored to store, serve and compute multi-dimensional Earth observation data products. It simplifies and speeds-up common user-data interaction procedures such as querying, indexing and processing Earth observation data compared to more traditional approaches of managing data (e.g. self-administered file systems). In addition, it eases collaboration on data, since Open Data Cube instances can be hosted on a server, e.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: Migratory movements of white storks Ciconia ciconia on a Mapbox satellite base map This month, our open-access paper on visualizing movement trajectories in R using moveVis has been published in the latest issue of Methods in Ecology and Evolution. The article describes the moveVis user functions, explains their technical implementation, provides use cases and discusses its strengths and limitations.&#xA;The visualization of movement trajectories sometimes is not easy.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: This year’s attendees of our annual PhD colloquium at EOC in Oberpfaffenhofen. Last Thursday, on November 28th, 2019, our annual PhD colloquium took place at the Earth Observation Center (EOC) at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen. As every year, the current PhD students of Prof. Dr. Stefan Dech met to present the concepts and statuses of their PhDs and to discuss their approaches and ideas within a larger group. As last year, the presentations provided interesting insights into the accomplishments and challenges of the PhD projects and showed the scientific progress that has been made during this last year.</description>

      <title>Spectral unmixing in R using RStoolbox</title>

      <description>Recently, I finished the development of the first version of a spectral unmixing function being part of RStoolbox, an R package offering numerous tools for remote sensing analysis written by Benjamin Leutner. The multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (mesma) function makes it possible to unmix multi- and hyper-spectral imagery by sets of spectral endmember profiles.&#xA;Figure 1: The RStoolbox::mesma() workflow. For this, a non-negative least squares (NNLS) solver was implemented.</description>

Source: Peter K Burian/CC BY-SA The Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) is the most widespread scavenging bird on the american continents, ranging from southern Canada to the tip of South America. Since 2003, the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary is collecting movement data of Turkey Vultures to investigate their migration behaviours, using radio tags monitored by satellite. 21 Turkey Vultures have been tracked during that period of time.</description>

      <description>Figure 1: An Albatross in the air. Source: pexels.com In the framework of the AniMove summer school 2017, the moveVis R package was introduced to the participants, resulting in several likewise interesting and beautiful animal movement animations. The shown animation displays the movement of Procellariiformes near Marion Island, South Africa, against the multi-temporal, daily NOAA sea surface temperature product G1SST. It was created by Tegan Carpenter-Kling, who is a PhD candidate within the Marine Apex Predator Research Unit (MAPRU) based at Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.</description>
